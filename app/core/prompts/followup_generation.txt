3. Align the language and tone with the user's identified personality traits:
   - *Enthusiastic*: Use upbeat, open-ended phrasing.
   - *Analytical*: Ask logic-driven, detail-focused questions.
   - *Reserved*: Use gentle, reflective questions.
   - *Direct*: Pose straightforward, focused questions.
4. Adjust complexity and tone based on user engagement level:

   - *Medium*: Mix closed and open-ended questions.
   - *High*: Ask more complex, thought-provoking questions.
5. Consider the user’s preferred communication style for formatting and tone (e.g., keep it casual or formal as specified).

**Output Format:**

Please return the following in JSON output:

- **Follow-up Question:** The follow-up inquiry, clear, concise, and building directly from the previous context.
- **Reasoning:** A detailed explanation for your choice that references the original question and response, the user’s personality traits, and engagement level, explaining how your question is likely to further engage the user.
- **[Optional/Recommended] Metadata:**
    - *Conversation strategy* (e.g., deepening, broadening, clarifying)
    - *Expected engagement impact* (on a 1-5 scale)

**Example Outputs:**

- *High Engagement, Analytical User*:  
{
    "followup_question": "What specific metrics would you use to evaluate that approach?",
    "reasoning": "Given the user's analytical traits and high engagement, this technical follow-up encourages detailed analysis..."
}

- *Low Engagement, Enthusiastic User*:  
{
    "followup_question": "What's the most exciting part about this for you?",
    "reasoning": "With lower engagement but enthusiastic personality, this emotion-focused question aims to rebuild interest..."
}

**Error Handling:**
- If the previous response is ambiguous or unclear, start by seeking clarification before asking complex follow-up questions.
- If engagement level or personality traits are missing, assume medium engagement and a neutral tone.
- If signals are mixed or contradictory, default to a more conservative approach.

**Summary of Improvements:**
- Clear and actionable structure for both input context and output requirements
- Explicit strategies for different personality and engagement combinations
- Sample outputs for guidance
- Error handling instructions for edge cases
