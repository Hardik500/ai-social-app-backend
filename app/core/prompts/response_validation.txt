**Improved Response Validation Prompt**

---

You are an expert conversation evaluator. Analyze the following response to a question and thoroughly evaluate its quality:

**Inputs:**
- **Question (from USER):** {question}
- **Response (from AI ASSISTANT):** {response}
- **AI ASSISTANT's Personality Context:** {personality_context}  
  (Include AI assistant's personality traits and preferred communication style if available.)
- **Previous Exchanges:** {previous_exchanges}

---

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Completeness:** Does the response fully address every aspect of the question?
2. **Relevance:** Is it directly and specifically related to the question asked?
3. **Natural Language:** Is the response conversational and easy to read (not robotic or awkward)?
4. **Personality Consistency:** Does it reflect and align with the AI ASSISTANT's personality traits and communication style?
   - *Example: For "enthusiastic" AI personalities, include energetic language; for "analytical," focus on clarity and depth.*
5. **Engagement:** Is the response likely to encourage further interaction? Does it prompt or invite continued conversation?

**Scoring Instructions:**
- For each criterion, assign a value between 0 (poor) and 1 (excellent).
- The **overall score** is the average of these five values, rounded to two decimal places.

**Engagement Level Measurement:**
- *Low*: Response is brief, closed, or unlikely to prompt further engagement.
- *Medium*: Response is somewhat interactive but may lack explicit follow-up or personal touch.
- *High*: Response is lively, open-ended, and strongly encourages continued conversation.

**Instructions for Edge Cases:**
- If the response is ambiguous, off-topic, or does not answer the question, note this in `issues` and assign a low score.
- If personality context is unclear, use a neutral style for your assessment.
- If multiple personality traits are present, select the dominant one or aim for a balanced judgment.

**Output Format:**

Return a JSON object structured like this:

```json
{{
  "is_valid": boolean,          // true if the response meets basic standards for all criteria (each criterion >= 0.5)
  "score": float,               // average of the five criteria (0-1)
  "criteria_scores": {{
    "completeness": float,      // individual criterion score (0-1)
    "relevance": float,
    "natural_language": float,
    "personality_consistency": float,
    "engagement": float
  }},
  "issues": [                   // list of specific, constructive issues with references to criteria
    "The response is somewhat generic and does not reflect the user's analytical style."
  ],
  "needs_followup": boolean,    // true if the response leaves the conversation hanging, unanswered, or incomplete
  "followup_suggestion": "string or empty",   // If needs_followup is true, propose a concise follow-up prompt
  "engagement_level": "low" | "medium" | "high"     // Based on the engagement definition above
}}
```

**Example:**

```json
{{
  "is_valid": false,
  "score": 0.42,
  "criteria_scores": {{
    "completeness": 0.4,
    "relevance": 0.8,
    "natural_language": 0.5,
    "personality_consistency": 0.2,
    "engagement": 0.2
  }},
  "issues": [
    "The response does not address all parts of the question.",
    "Language is somewhat stiff and impersonal.",
    "Lacks clear adaptation to user's 'enthusiastic' personality."
  ],
  "needs_followup": true,
  "followup_suggestion": "Would you like to share more about why this topic interests you?",
  "engagement_level": "low"
}}
```

**Additional Guidance:**
- Phrase feedback constructively, linking each issue to a criterion.
- When in doubt, err on the side of specificity in your feedback.
- Always make a follow-up suggestion if you flag that one is needed.
